"""Drolta SQLite Query Engine Wrapper.

Drolta is a query engine that wraps a  SQLite database to allow
users to write queries that are more declarative, composable,
and legible than raw SQL. Drolta was originally developed for a
video game-inspired simulation that relied heavily on SQLite to
manage character and world data. We needed more accessible query
language for users not familiar with SQL. Drolta pulls inspiration
from logic languages like Prolog and Datalog to give users an
easy to use database querying experience.
